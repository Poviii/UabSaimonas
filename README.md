A website for my dad's floorlaying company.

He already has a made website that runs on Joomla, but he has basically no control over it, because it is difficult to use, and I find the UI to be rather user-unfriendly. That right there is the exact reason why I'm making this website, that is that I want to have control over the images and other stuff, plus I am a beginner in programming, so I think, well I hope, that I will learn from this.
